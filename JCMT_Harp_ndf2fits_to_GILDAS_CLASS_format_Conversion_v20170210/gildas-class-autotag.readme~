This is version 20161028. 

This code is used to autotag each subscan in each day's observation data, for example: 
    "demo/NGC253/20160722/dataset_20151202_00030_HCN/b_receptors_class.30m"
    "demo/NGC253/20160722/dataset_20160715_00062_HCO+/b_receptors_class.30m"

The output data are for example: 
    "demo/NGC253/20160722/dataset_20151202_00030_HCN/b_receptors_class_tagged.30m"
    "demo/NGC253/20160722/dataset_20160715_00062_HCO+/b_receptors_class_tagged.30m"

Currently we are still using a very simple way to compute the qualities:
    first set window to mask edge channels, 
    then compute RMS for each subscan spectrum, 
    then compute the mean and rms of the RMS of all subscans in a day's observation (named autotagmean and autotagrms), 
    then determine qualities:
        1 : each spectrum's RMS < (autotagmean-2*autotagrms)
        2 : each spectrum's RMS < (autotagmean-1*autotagrms)
        3 : each spectrum's RMS < (autotagmean+0*autotagrms)
        4 : each spectrum's RMS < (autotagmean+1*autotagrms)
        5 : each spectrum's RMS < (autotagmean+2*autotagrms)
        6 : each spectrum's RMS < (autotagmean+3*autotagrms)
        7 : each spectrum's RMS < (autotagmean+4*autotagrms)
        8 : all worse spectra. 

Current drawback: 
    This code is not considering Tsys of each day's observation. 
    For example, if the overall RMS in one day 1 is higher than in another day 2, 
    this code will rank the qualities individually for day 1 and day 2, 
    and day 1's high quality spectra are actually only median quality in day 2. 
    When finally merging all days, this will cause some problem.
